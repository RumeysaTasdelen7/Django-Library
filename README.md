I developed this project using Django and utilized SQLite as the database. This comprehensive backend project, developed alongside Django Rest Framework (DRF), includes commands for adding, updating, and deleting information such as books, authors, categories, addresses, and more. The application, which successfully stores information in the database, also provides detailed functionalities like borrowing books and filtering by categories. By leveraging Django's robust structure and SQLite's database management capabilities, the project was developed efficiently and is scalable.
